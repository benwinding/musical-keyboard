## 🎶 musical-keyboard ⌨️

This is a tiny program that plays a note for each key you type!

## Try it out?

```
npx musical-keyboard
```

```
You can change the scale of what notes are available too.
```

It runs globally, so you could leave it open and listen to keyboard notes all day while you type! 😅
